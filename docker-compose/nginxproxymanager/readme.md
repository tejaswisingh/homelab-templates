Log in to the Admin UI

When your docker container is running, connect to it on port 81 for the admin interface. Sometimes this can take a little bit because of the entropy of keys.

Default Admin User:

Email:    admin@example.com
Password: changeme

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.
