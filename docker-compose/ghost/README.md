During the installation process, Ghost does not create an Admin user by default. To access your Ghost Dashboard, you must first create a Ghost Admin user. This can be done via your browser immediately following the installation process.

To access your Ghost registration page, simply navigate to your Ghost installation using the following URL:

http://example.com/ghost

Please remember to change "example.com" with your actual domain name or IP address on which your Ghost installation can be accessed.

This will redirect you to the Ghost Sign-up page at https://example.com/ghost/signup/

Please input your name, email address, and desired password on the Sign-Up page. Be advised that your password should be at least eight symbols.
